# Online Shop App (Android + Firebase)

This project is an educational Android application created using:
- **Kotlin**
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
- **Firebase Realtime Database**
- **LiveData & ViewModel**

This application demonstrates the basic capabilities of an online store

The project is based on a [YouTube training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh1GXnFw7rM&list=WL&index=6&t=2167s), which will have my personal additional changes soon.
